**nxthdr**, pronounced /ˈnɛkst ˈhɛdə˞/ or simply "Next Header", is an initiative to offer metrology capabilities to researcher or inviduals for beneficent open projects.

The goals of **nxthdr** are multiple:
* Provide a transparent and open infrastructure for researchers, students and individuals to conduct experiments.
* Offer open-source tools to facilitate the collection and analysis of data.
* Offer open data to the community.
* Offer a [platform](https://discord.gg/KRsVs7jafg) for the community to share their research and findings.

The network infrastructure supporting **nxthdr** is [**as215011**](/as215011), an independant asynchronous system announcing multiple ipv6 prefixes.
