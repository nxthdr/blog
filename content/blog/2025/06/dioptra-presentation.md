Here are the slides from a presentation I gave to the [Dioptra](https://dioptra.io/#/) research group. The audience was primarily interested in an overview of the **nxthdr** project, with a particular focus on the design of the probing pipeline, [saimiris](https://github.com/nxthdr/saimiris).

<!--more-->

We had engaging discussions about the use of an event bus like Kafka, the idea of allowing users to define their own probes, and the key differences with their own probing platform, [iris](https://github.com/dioptra-io/iris).

Several interesting questions were raised, particularly regarding the handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in open datasets, as well as the technical requirements of saimiris in terms of scalability, multitenancy, and performance.
