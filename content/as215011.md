**as215011** is the network infrastructure supporting **nxthdr**. We currently administrate the Asynchronous System (AS)[215011](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/36080), announcing ipv6 prefixes only.

**Present in the following IXPs**

```
FogIXP - Frankfurt
LOCIX  - Frankfurt
NL-IX  - Amesterdam
```

**Prefixes announced**

```
2a06:de00:50::/44  - NXTHDR
2a0e:97c0:8a0::/44 - NXTHDR-RESEARCH
2a06:de01:d0::/44  - DSCP
```

We embrace a radical transparency approach, so you can view the full [configuration](https://github.com/nxthdr/as215011) of **as215011** routers. If you identify a security issue, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request in the repository. Alternatively, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KRsVs7jafg) server or email us at [admin@nxthdr.dev](mailto:admin@nxthdr.dev).

## Peering policy

**as215011** operates an open peering policy and can also provide transit for other ASes, either through direct peering at IXPs or via a WireGuard tunnel. We enforce RPKI filtering with a refresh interval of 900 seconds.
