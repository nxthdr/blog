**as215011** is the network infrastructure supporting **nxthdr**. We currently administrate the Asynchronous System (AS)[215011](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/36080), announcing IPv6 prefixes.

This AS  is not intended to provide connectivity for industry or commercial purposes. We aim to provide an independent network for researchers and students to measure the Internet. Users can use this network using our probing infrastructure, but can also peer with us to conduct experiments.

In the future, we plan to provide self-service peering capabilities for users to control the announcements of prefixes during their experiments. Check our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/nxthdr/projects/1) for more information!

The BGP data from **as215011** is made freely available to the community for analysis.

**IXPs presence**

**Announced prefixes**

```
2a06:de00:50::/44  - NXTHDR
2a0e:97c0:8a0::/44 - NXTHDR-RESEARCH

```

We embrace a radical transparency approach, so you can view the full [configuration](https://github.com/nxthdr/infrastructure/tree/main/networks) of **as215011** routers. If you identify a security issue, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request in the repository. Alternatively, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KRsVs7jafg) server or email us at [admin@nxthdr.dev](mailto:admin@nxthdr.dev).

## Peering policy

**as215011** operates an open peering policy and can also provide transit for other ASes, either through direct peering at IXPs or via a WireGuard tunnel. We enforce RPKI filtering with a refresh interval of 900 seconds.
