We currently administrate the Asynchronous System (AS)[215011](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/36080), announcing multiple IPv6 prefixes.

The **as215011** network is currently IPv6-only and is connected to multiple Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in Europe. It is used for conducting routing and peering experiments and can also be combined with the **nxthdr** probing platform to perform active measurements while controlling prefix announcements during experiments. Additionally, it is possible to peer with **as215011** for experimental or non-commercial purposes.

The **as215011** network is used to provide connectivity to the **nxthdr** [infrastructure](/infrastructure), allowing us to dogfood our own network.

Routing data collected by **as215011** routers is made freely [available](/datasets) to everyone for analysis.

**IXPs presence**

```
FogIXP - Frankfurt
LOCIX  - Frankfurt
NL-IX  - Amsterdam
```

**Announced prefixes**

```
2a06:de00:50::/44  - NXTHDR
2a0e:97c0:8a0::/44 - NXTHDR-RESEARCH
2a06:de01:d0::/44  - DSCP
```

We embrace a radical transparency approach, so you can view the full [configuration](https://github.com/nxthdr/infrastructure/tree/main/networks) of **as215011** routers. If you identify a security issue, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request in the repository. Alternatively, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KRsVs7jafg) server or email us at [admin@nxthdr.dev](mailto:admin@nxthdr.dev).


## Peering Policy

**as215011** operates an open peering policy and can also provide transit for other ASes, either through direct peering at IXPs or via a WireGuard tunnel. We enforce RPKI filtering with a refresh interval of 900 seconds.
