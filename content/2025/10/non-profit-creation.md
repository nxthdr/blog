The future of this project depends on our ability to raise funds to maintain and grow our infrastructure. So far, our goal has been to provide a proof-of-concept and support at least one research project and one university course.

Moving forward, if we want to grow and support more research projects and university courses, we need to raise funds. We are currently exploring grant opportunities and sponsorships. It is also possible for us to provide some paid services, mainly targeted to universities and research institutions.

The funding will be used to maintain and grow our infrastructure. It will include renting peering and probing servers, compute and storage resources, internet resources such as IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes and potentially more AS numbers. Ideally, we would also like to provide internships to students interested in network research and development.

We are very excited about this new chapter! If you are interested in supporting our work please reach out to [admin@nxthdr.dev](mailto:admin@nxthdr.dev).
