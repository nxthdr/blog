Hey, I'm [Matthieu Gouel](https://matthieugouel.name/). My [PhD](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04164622v1/document) was about measuring the Internet with a lot of pings and traceroutes, and then use this vast amount of data to improve our knwoledge of how the Internet works in practice. To be honest, I was more interested in building the tools and platforms than writing papers.

I believe the Internet measurement community is still lacking fundamental tools that enable rapid experimentation of new ideas at Internet-scale. While many tools and platforms have come and gone over the years, often driven by researchers and students as part of their academic work, the few production-ready platforms available tend to be closed source, outdated, or lack self-service features for performing experiments.

I had the opportunity to work in a well-known lab alongside amazing researchers who are well-known in the community. This gave me the chance to connect with people and gain access to datasets and platforms. But unfortunately, that such opportunities may not be as easily available to those working independently or in smaller labs.

**nxthdr** and **as215011** are not flashy, disruptive new testbeds. In fact, they build on common ideas that have existed for a long time, such as a BGP testbed [^1] and a high-speed probing platform [^2]. The real edge lies in combining these ideas into a single platform and making it open, accessible to everyone and community-driven.
